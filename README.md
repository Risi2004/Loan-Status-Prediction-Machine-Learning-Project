# Loan-Status-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, from data preparation and model training to making predictions on new, unseen data. The SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks, particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces.

The diagram above illustrates the key steps involved:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Starting with raw input data.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Transforming the data into a suitable format for the SVM algorithm.
3.  **Train-Test Split:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets to ensure robust model evaluation.
4.  **Model Training:** Training the SVM model on the training data to learn optimal decision boundaries (hyperplanes).
5.  **Prediction:** Utilizing the trained SVM model to classify or predict outcomes for new data.

## Features

* **Clear Workflow:** Step-by-step implementation of SVM.
* **Data Preprocessing Examples:** Includes common data cleaning and preparation techniques.
* **Model Training & Evaluation:** Demonstrates how to train an SVM and evaluate its performance.
* **Prediction Pipeline:** Shows how to use the trained model for inference on new data.
